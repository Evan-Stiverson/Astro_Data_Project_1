# Astronomy Wordle Game
A fully functional Wordle-style game featuring astronomy terminology, built with Python and powered by Claude AI for hints and educational content.
Overview
This project implements a complete Wordle game using 5-letter astronomy terms. Players have 6 attempts to guess the word, receiving color-coded feedback after each guess:

ðŸŸ© GREEN: Letter is correct and in the right position
ðŸŸ¨ YELLOW: Letter is in the word but in the wrong position
â¬œ GRAY: Letter is not in the word

The system tracks player statistics, provides AI-generated hints, and offers educational content about each astronomy term after the game concludes.
Features

AI-Powered Hints: Get contextual hints using Claude AI (requires API key)
Educational Content: Learn about each astronomy term after completing a game
Statistics Tracking: Track your wins, streaks, and guess distribution
Visual Statistics: Beautiful matplotlib visualizations of your gameplay stats
Persistent Storage: Game statistics are saved and loaded automatically
